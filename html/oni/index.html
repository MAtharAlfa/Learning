      <p class="text-limit-hero">
        Onigiri or rice ball is a Japanese traditional food. It is made from
        white rice wrapped in nori. Usually onigiri is filled with salmon,
        katsuobushi or something else. The ingredient is salty or sour. Japanese
        stores have onigiri with various flavours.

    <div class="img-text">
      <p>
        Onigiri (お握り or 御握り), also known as omusubi (お結び), nigirimeshi
        (握り飯), or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed
        into triangular or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori.
        Traditionally, an onigiri is filled with pickled ume (umeboshi), salted
        salmon, katsuobushi, kombu, tarako, mentaiko, takanazuke (pickled
        takana, Japanese giant red mustard greens) or any other salty or sour
        ingredient as a natural preservative. Because it is easily portable and
        eaten by hand, onigiri has been used as portable food or bento from
        ancient times to the present day. Originally, it was used as a way to
        use and store left-over rice, but it later became a regular meal. Many
        Japanese convenience stores and supermarkets stock their onigiri with
        various fillings and flavors. It has become so mainstream that it is
        even served in izakayas and sit-down restaurants. There are even
        specialized shops which only sell onigiri to take out. Due to the
        popularity of this trend in Japan, onigiri has become a popular staple
        in Japanese restaurants worldwide.

    <h2 id="Geo" class="center-flex sub-title">History</h2>
    <p class="text-limit center-text">
      Before the use of chopsticks became widespread, in the Nara period, rice
      was often rolled into a small ball so that it could be easily picked up.
      In the Heian period, rice was made into small rectangular shapes known as
      tonjiki so that they could be piled onto a plate and easily eaten. At that
      time, onigiri were called tonjiki and often consumed at outdoor picnic
      lunches.
